x25519/
	The modified X25519 implementation that was verified 
	This is based on the "small" version in:
		https://munacl.cryptojedi.org/curve25519-atmega.shtml

	The file 'patch' contains all changes made to the original


All proofs can be replayed by typing 'make'. This may some some time.
Proofs may fail due to timeout if your computer is significantly slower
than our machine:

* Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHz, with 32GB RAM
* GNU/Linux 10 (buster); amd64

Proofs can be inspected using the why3 ide ("./why3 ide file.mlw");
this requires CVC3,CVC4,Z3,E and Why3. A tar-ball with binaries that work
on a Debian buster installation can be downloaded at:
